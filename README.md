When you get stuck on your back at General Assembly, this application will help you get back on your feet. You can view this application at: https://turt-le.herokuapp.com/
##Approach
We identified a need to provide a streamlined approach for students in General Assembly to request help with problems they're having with their assignments, which allows other students and/or instructors and TAs to respond with a solution.
We built our application using Express and Sequelize on Node Javascript. Our first step to building this application was to identify what we wanted the user experience to be. Then we focused on planning and back and functionality. Once we have some functionality done, half our team focused on front-end. We provided help to each struggling member. We then merged everything together and tackled the remaining issues.
##Requirements
This application requires Node, Express and Sequelize to be already installed.
